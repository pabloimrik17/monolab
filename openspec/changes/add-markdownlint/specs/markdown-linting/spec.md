## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Markdown Linting Integration

The monorepo SHALL integrate markdownlint-cli into the pre-commit workflow via lint-staged to automatically lint all staged Markdown files before commit.

#### Scenario: Markdown files linted on commit

- **WHEN** a developer commits changes containing staged `*.md` files
- **THEN** markdownlint runs on those files via the lint-staged hook
- **AND** the commit proceeds if no unfixable errors are found

#### Scenario: Linting errors block commit

- **WHEN** a Markdown file has unfixable linting errors
- **THEN** the pre-commit hook fails
- **AND** the developer is shown the specific errors
- **AND** the commit is blocked until errors are resolved

### Requirement: Auto-fixing Capability

The markdownlint integration SHALL automatically fix fixable Markdown issues during the pre-commit hook execution.

#### Scenario: Auto-fix applied on commit

- **WHEN** a staged Markdown file has fixable issues (e.g., trailing spaces, inconsistent list markers)
- **THEN** markdownlint automatically fixes those issues
- **AND** the fixed content is staged for commit
- **AND** the commit proceeds successfully

### Requirement: Directory Exclusion

The markdownlint configuration SHALL support exclusion of specific directories via `.markdownlintignore` to prevent linting of generated, vendor, or AI-specific Markdown files.

#### Scenario: Ignored directories not linted

- **WHEN** Markdown files exist in excluded directories (openspec/, .claude/, .opencode/, node_modules/, dist/, coverage/)
- **THEN** markdownlint does not process those files
- **AND** no linting errors are reported for them

#### Scenario: AI agent instruction files excluded

- **WHEN** AI agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) are modified
- **THEN** markdownlint ignores them via `.markdownlintignore`
- **AND** they are not subject to standard Markdown formatting rules

#### Scenario: Auto-generated CHANGELOG files excluded

- **WHEN** CHANGELOG.md files exist in any package (auto-generated by Nx Release)
- **THEN** markdownlint ignores them via `.markdownlintignore`
- **AND** prettier ignores them via `.prettierignore`
- **AND** ESLint ignores them via `eslint.config.ts`
- **AND** they are never modified by any linting or formatting tool

### Requirement: Configurable Rules

The markdownlint integration SHALL support custom rule configuration via `.markdownlintrc` file, with sensible defaults if the configuration file is omitted.

#### Scenario: Default rules applied

- **WHEN** no `.markdownlintrc` file exists
- **THEN** markdownlint uses its default rule set
- **AND** all Markdown files are linted according to markdownlint defaults

#### Scenario: Custom rules applied

- **WHEN** a `.markdownlintrc` file exists with custom rule configuration
- **THEN** markdownlint applies those custom rules instead of defaults
- **AND** all Markdown files are linted according to the custom configuration
